## Airfield Simulator Project

### Description

This is a simple console-based Java application source code for manipulating an array of jet objects through a console-based user menu. Emphasis was placed on using proper OOP principles of design.

### Topics and Technologies Used

* OOP
* I/O filereader
* arrays
* ArrayLists
* conditionals
* for & while loops
* switch statement
* toString()

### How to Run

Download all appropriate class files, compile java application and run JetsApplication. Follow prompts.

### Lessons Learned

My main challenge with this project was properly using encapsulation to manipulate the jet objects properly. I had placed too many method calls in my main app which had to be completely stripped down and the functionality rebuilt in the airfiled object.
