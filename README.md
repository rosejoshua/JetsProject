## Airfield Simulator Project

### Description

This is a simple console-based Java application source code for manipulating an array of jet objects through a console-based user menu. Special care was taken to apply OOP principles of design.

### Topics and Technologies Used

* OOP
* arrays
* conditionals
* for & while loops
* toString()

### How to Run

Download both FoodTruck.Java and FoodTruckApp.java, compile java application and run FoodTruckApp. Follow prompts.

### Lessons Learned

This project went better than predicted with no issue taking especially long to troubleshoot. Properly referencing method calling objects within the FoodTruckApp methods provided the majority of my learning experience with this project. What I found most interesting was that I could fill an array with FoodTruck objects without actually using a named variable to contain the references to these objects. This was very practical as I don't know of any way to uniquely set name variables in a for-loop using the iteration number. Instead, I was simply able to immediately assign the reference to the constructed object in the array during the for-loop iteration calling the constructor. Similarly, I was able to call on the object's getters, setters, and toString() methods using the iterated location in the array.
